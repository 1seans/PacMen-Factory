# PacMen-Factory
Pac-Man game in which multiple Pac-Man characters move around on a page and bounce off the edges of the page when they reach it. It does this by using a factory function called makePac to generate Pac-Man characters with random positions and velocities, and by using the update function to move the characters and detect when they reach the edge of the page. The checkCollisions function is used to reverse the characters' velocities when a collision is detected. The makeOne function is used to add new Pac-Man characters to the game. The code also includes an export statement that makes some of the functions available for use in other modules.
